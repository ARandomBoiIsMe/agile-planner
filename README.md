# agile-planner

Solves the perpetual problem of creating a work schedule that is both dynamic in nature but intelligent enough to be actually functional:
* Autogenerate an entire work schedule via each task's time duration and due date proximity
* Balances all tasks intelligently with a distributive mindset
* Customizeable tasks for greater flexibility (along with schedule regeneration)
* Local log of all events and errors reported by system
